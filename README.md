Overview:

Spotify Search Playground - This is what I imagine a proof of concept for the first iteration of the search feature was like.

- Allows users to query song, artist information, and discover top music playlists using Spotifyâ€™s web api.
- Presents the most relevant and accurate results to the user for easy reference

Primary Goals:

- Song Search = Allow users to search any song title and the UI to display THE most popular and relevant search result.
- Artist Search = Allow users to search for any artist and the 10 most relevant and popular songs, albums, and release date information display on the UI for the user.
- Allow user to click on the individual results to view more details about the song.
